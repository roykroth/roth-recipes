image: e402b9d1-adf7-4e74-8871-914c46c8b4dd.jpg

ingredients:
- 153 grams 00 flour
- 153 grams all-purpose flour
- 200 grams water
- 8 grams fine sea salt
- 2 grams active dry yeast
- 4 grams extra-virgin olive oil

directions:
- In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.
- In a small mixing bowl, stir together water, yeast olive oil. 
- Pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
- Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)
- To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.
